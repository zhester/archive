Single Script Applications
==========================

This area is a compilation of utility/administration scripts I
wrote that function as a stand-alone file.  The intent is to
make deployment easy, instant, and without any hassle that comes
with zip archives and uploading pictures and support files.

Furthermore, these scripts take a shot at zero-configuration whereever
possible.  Most can be customized by editing a configuration array.
Some can take out a little session configuration (required each time
you access the script) and made permanent.

- file_browser.php: Browses files on host (similar to Apache: Options Indexes)
- file64.php: Base64 file content encoder
- ssdb.php: Very basic MySQL database interface
- stringcode.php: Various string encoding/decoding
