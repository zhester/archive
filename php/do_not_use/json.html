<h1>JSON</h1>
<p>
	This is just a quick and simple way to build a JSON document out
	of a PHP array.  Compared to other PHP code I've seen, this is
	about as minimal as it gets.  The optional second parameter allows
	people to use apostrophes instead of quotes if they want to do
	something crazy (this doesn't conform to any JSON spec I've seen,
	but it was easy and I have an irrational fear of quotation marks).
