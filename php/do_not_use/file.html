<h1>File Path Abstraction</h1>
<p>
	If you've ever designed an application that needs to handle
	files from users and be able to easily adapt to new directory
	structures, you know how challenging this can be.  Not to mention
	this is an easy place for security holes to sneak into a large
	application.  Besides that, applications on the web have to
	differentiate between two contexts: the filesystem and the URI
	path.
</p>
<p>
	This class is largely inspired by banging my head against the
	wall and one of the cool features in Java: an abstract object
	to act as a path, but allow much more functionality, reliability,
	intelligence, and security.
