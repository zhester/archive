<h1>CSS2 Rounded Box</h1>

<p>
	For browsers that provide strong CSS2 support and PNG-24
	rendering, here is a method to provide a somewhat stylish rounded
	box based on a very primitive document fragment.
</p>

<h2>Document Fragment</h2>
<?php display_code('.example'); ?>
<p>
	For this to work, we need to use two semantically-null elements.
	First, we need to know what parts of the document will be included
	in the box.  This is the surrounding <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.
	It's also convenient to use this <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag as
	the root for selectors.  Second, we need to allow any kind and any
	number of interior block elements in the body of the box.  Thus,
	we need another document delimiter (the interior
	<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag).  Since these demarcations have no
	relevance to the information, it's okay to use semantically-null
	elements.  The regions where the information needs to be marked,
	are the heading and any body elements (which remain unknown to
	this style sheet).
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<?php deliver_code('.example'); ?>

<h2>Style Sheet</h2>
<?php display_code('.css'); ?>
<p>
	To download the images, just follow the URLs in the style sheet,
	or use a browser that allows you to "View background image..."
	or "Save background as..."
</p>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>
	It will always be a dream of mine to allow this same document
	fragment to be styled with the maximum versatility:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The corner images must be placed as independent images.</li>
	<li>The other images must tile on all four edges (removing the
		maximum width limitation).</li>
	<li>The exterior areas of the box (where the rounding leaves space
		"behind" the box) must be transparent to allow the exterior
		background (or content) to remain visible.  The current
		solutions rely on the graphics' backgrounds to cover up parts of
		other graphics.</li>
	<li>After all that, it might be nice to use some actual background
		images to pretty-up the interior of the box.</li>
</ul>
