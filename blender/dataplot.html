<h1>Data Plotter</h1>

<p>
	Most math packages and charting programs these days can generate 3D
	charts, but the capabilities and control over those charts is generally
	very limited.  This script is my very first attempt at building a
	plugin for Blender to facilitate a mesh generation system to render
	3D charts.
</p>


<h2>An Example</h2>

<p>
	Let's say I have some data for some important purpose.  I've exported
	it from my preferred data/math package to a neutral CSV format:
</p>

<?php display_code('.csv'); ?>

<p>
	The Blender plugin loads the CSV data directly from the file, and
	charts this information as a field of bars (currently, the only
	chart type available).  Each series sits in its own row down the
	X axis.  The series are separated from each other down the Y axis.
</p>
<p>
	In the below image, the first series (the first column in the CSV file)
	is positioned closer to the camera.  The second series is further from
	the camera.  The values are displayed in order from left to right
	(top to bottom in the CSV file).
</p>

<h2>Another Example</h2>

<p>
	The previous example is just a plain bar chart without any materials
	on the default background.  Here is one of the charts I've produced
	with this script with a little more polish:

<h2>Future Development</h2>

<p>
	I am trying to add support for pie charts and other chart types
	(just about anything that looks good illustrated in three dimensions).
	Once I have broadened the capabilities, I'm going to revise the UI,
	and add as much customization to the mesh generation options as I deem
	necessary.
</p>


<h2>The Code</h2>

<p>
	The script is written as a Blender plugin script, but it has not been
	tested as a plugin yet (I just have the script loaded into the script
	editor in Blender).  I will post more updates here as I can.
</p>

<?php display_code('.py'); ?>
