<h1>CSS DOM Extension</h1>
<p>
	I've been working with a lot of client-side scripting lately, and seem
	to keep running into situations where it would simplify life (and improve
	performance) if I could hook into the existing style sheets and modify
	visual styling on a document-wide level (instead of manipulating individual
	elements and/or goofing around with class membership).
</p>
<p>
	This code extends the CSS DOM capabilities of a compliant browser to
	enable flexible access to styling rules.
</p>
<p>
	The important feature is the addition of the applyStyle() method to
	the CSSStyleSheet object.  This method accepts a selector string,
	a CSS property name, and a CSS style value.  If the selector is
	found to already exist in the style sheet, the rule is updated (to
	preserve the order of fall-through styles).  Another important
	feature is the addition of the removeStyle() method which allows a
	script to completely remove a style rule section based on an accurate
	specification of the selector for that rule.
</p>
<p>
	Note: This probably won't work in MSIE.  Adapting for use in that
	browser is left as an exercise for the reader.
