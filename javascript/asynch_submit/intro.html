<h1>Asynchronous Form Submission</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
	I developed this bit of JavaScript to allow me to create a
	user-friendly way to send form data to the server without taking
	the user from their current page.  This way, a user can work on
	a large document and make periodic "saves" without breaking
	workflow.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
	As with most general-purpose JavaScript, I had to find a balance
	between ease of programming and flexibility.  I arrived at a very
	simple model to handle the asynchronous nature of "behind the scenes"
	HTTP requests:
</p>
<pre>
interface_function(
    <em>mixed</em> context_parameter,
    <em>function</em> response_handler
);
</pre>
<p>
	Based on the application, the context parameter and the response
	handler may be used or controlled differently.  For instance, the
	context parameter may be an ID for DOM reference or a DOM node
	itself.  Another example is that a response handler may be passed
	either plain text, an array, or an XML DOM node from the response
	of the HTTP request.
</p>
<p>
	In this application, the context is a form, so the ID of the form
	is used.  The response from the server should be a simple message
	intended to tell the user the result of the request.  Thus, the
	response handler should take a single parameter that's a string.
	At that point, the handler may use a dynamic node, alert box,
	or another form field to pass the message on to the user.
</p>
<h3>Submitting a Form in "Stealth Mode"</h3>
<p>
	One of the great things about this code is that it doesn't need any
	special facility from the form or the form processor to operate as
	if it were a regular form submission.  The client form can be the
	exact same form that is used for standard submission.  The server-side
	processor can sometimes be the same script.  The only problem is
	that a form processor usually responds with a web page or a redirect
	to a web page.  This means the response string will be an entire
	page when all we want is a simple message.  That's why the submission
	function will send a special query variable called
	<code>asynch_submission</code> set to <code>true</code>.  This allows
	a server-side processor to tell if the form was submitted out of
	the usual flow and respond accordingly.  Even then, the majority of
	a well-developed form processor should be nearly identical code
	making it possible to use a simple <code>if</code> statement at the
	end of the processor to either redirect or simply send the message.
</p>

<h2>Application Programming Interface</h2>
<p>
	Something (a user, a timer, another script, etc) has to call the
	submission function with the ID of the form that is being submitted
	and a reference to an event handler that will "catch" the response
	from the server.  The handler should take one argument that will
	contain the text.  It's up to the handler to decide how to show it
	to the user or do something else exciting.
</p>
<p>
	Example of the interface:
</p>
<pre>
asynch_submit(
    'form_id',
    function(response) {
        alert(response);
    }
);
</pre>

</p>
	The particulars of the submissions are determined from the form
	itself.  The action and method are read from the form's attributes
	with reasonable defaults (as the browser would on its own).
</p>
<p>
	It's important to note that the HTTP request won't always happen
	faster than a user is aware.  The button that submits the form
	should probably be disabled during the request to keep a user from
	submitting it twice with a double click.  When the response handler
	is called, the HTTP request has finished and the button can be enabled.
</p>
