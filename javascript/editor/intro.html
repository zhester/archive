<h1>Web-Based Content Editor</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
	This project started as an attempt to learn about and deploy a rich
	content editor for CMS-style applications.  So far, I've been
	pleasently surprised at how simple the basic concepts are.  I've
	been less happy about how different browsers connect their object
	chains between externally-loaded documents (iframe targets).
</p>
<p>
	At this point, I'm pretty happy with the basic functionality
	provided by this script.  There are many things to add and new
	methods to implement.  The interface may change a bit as well.
