<h1>Table of Contents Builder</h1>
<p>
	I like to author documents in HTML.  But, I don't like maintaining a
	table of contents for the internals of each document.  Here's a quick
	little script to dynamically generate a TOC with links to each section
	heading.
</p>
<p>
	The example output is almost completely unstyled.  It's expected that
	a style sheet would provide the visual bits to make the TOC look nice.
	I would also suggest better positioning rather than just inline with
	the rest of the document.  Depending on other aspects of your overall
	design, I find it easy to absolutely position the TOC off to one side
	of the page, or--better yet--to make it fixed so a visitor always has
	the TOC available regardless of where they are scrolled in the document.
