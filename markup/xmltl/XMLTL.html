<h1>XMLTL: XML Transport Layer</h1>

<p>
  An increasing transport need is for object serialization.
  Since nearly everything on the planet understands XML, this is
  a logical way to transport serialized data (similar to the mechanics
  behind JSON).
  In the end, my hope is to be able to access node data in target
  platforms as native objects--unaware if they were transported as
  JSON, XML, or carrier pidgeon.
